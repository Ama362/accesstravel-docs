== Our Commitment to Accessibility

AccessTravel is committed to making travel planning accessible and inclusive for everyone, including people with disabilities and access needs. Accessibility is central to our mission, and we design the platform to support travelers with a wide range of mobility, visual, hearing, cognitive, and sensory requirements.

We recognize that accessibility is an ongoing process, and we continuously work to improve the usability and inclusiveness of the platform.

== Scope of This Statement

This accessibility statement applies to the AccessTravel web application and its core features, including:

* User registration and accessibility profile setup
* Search and filtering of accommodations, attractions, restaurants, and transportation
* Accessibility-focused reviews and community content
* Trip planning tools and resource resources

Some third-party content or services integrated into the platform may not be fully accessible and are outside our direct control.

== Accessibility Standards

AccessTravel is designed to conform to the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1, Level AA.

These guidelines focus on ensuring that content is:

* *Perceivable* — Information can be presented in ways users can perceive
* *Operable* — Users can navigate and interact using different input methods
* *Understandable* — Content and interactions are clear and predictable
* *Robust* — Content works with assistive technologies and modern devices

== Accessibility Features

The AccessTravel platform includes the following accessibility features:

* Keyboard navigation support for core functionality
* Semantic HTML and structured headings to support screen readers
* Text alternatives for images where appropriate, including accessibility-related images
* Clear labels and instructions for forms and inputs
* Visible focus indicators for keyboard users
* High-contrast interface elements where supported
* Consistent layout and navigation patterns to reduce cognitive load

Features are designed and tested with assistive technologies such as screen readers and keyboard-only navigation in mind.

== User-Generated Content

AccessTravel includes community-contributed reviews, images, and descriptions. While we provide guidance and structured prompts to encourage accessible content, we cannot guarantee that all user-generated content meets accessibility standards.

We continue to improve tools and guidance that help contributors share accessibility information clearly and responsibly.

== Known Limitations

Despite our efforts, some accessibility limitations may exist, including:

* Variations in accessibility quality of user-uploaded images and videos
* Incomplete accessibility data for some locations due to limited community verification
* Accessibility limitations in third-party maps, transportation data, or external services

We actively monitor these areas and prioritize improvements based on user feedback.

== Feedback and Support

If you encounter accessibility barriers while using AccessTravel, or if you have suggestions for improvement, we welcome your feedback.

You can contact us through:

* Email: accessibility@accesstravel.com
* In-app feedback or support form

Please include details about the page or feature you were using and the issue encountered.

== Continuous Improvement

Accessibility is an ongoing commitment at AccessTravel. We regularly review the platform, update our practices, and incorporate feedback from users and the disability community.

This statement will be updated as the platform evolves and as further accessibility enhancements are made.
